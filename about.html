                    <h1>Hi there and thank you for visiting the site</h1>
                    <p>Here a little about me, I am an agricultural biotechnologist engineer who is passionate about building and designing websites, applications and maybe in the future video games, I am currently pursuing the career of Full Stack developer at Henry's school, but there is still a lot to learn ahead, I also like to study about nutrition, meditation, everything that has to do with the human body and how it works, music and many other things. 
                    </p>

                    <p> What you see in the home page is one of those little projects in which I usually work and merge my multiple passions, for example in the home page I show you about the pillars of a healthy life, within these even things as basic as eating your fruits and vegetables, as well as how it is necessary to take a moment alone every day to relax and reconnect with our inner power, higher self or God, whatever you call it. Everything I show you in the home page has been extensively studied by modern scientists and they have come to the conclusion that it is part of a healthy lifestyle. Well nothing I say goodbye to you with a big virtual hug and I hope you enjoy the content.
